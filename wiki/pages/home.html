    <h2>Styling your wiki</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.</p>
    <p>While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.</p>
    <p>Feel free to customize the page styling according to your preferences, or you can simply leave the style as it is. It's wise to focus on a clear content first, and on a clean design later.</p>
    <p>Be cautious with the size of the assets like images, videos, and more into your wiki. Large file sizes can hinder the presentation of wikis due to slow internet connections. Remember to compress large files before uploading them to iGEM servers.</p>
    <p>This default wiki meets the requirements, enhances navigability, and provides a user-friendly experience for visitors. You should not feel obliged to go beyond the provided styling.</p>
